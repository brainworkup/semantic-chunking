What are the key components of effective report writing according to the document?

<!-- ## Retrieved Context
```
As you read through the following suggestions for report writing, you may
note that sometimes the writing in this book violates the rules that we recommend. For example, we tell you not to use contractions when writing reports so
that the writing will be more formal in tone. We don’t, however, adhere to this
rule, because the style of writing in this book is more casual and conversational in
tone.

REPORT FRAMEWORK

Although the styles of reports will vary according to the person, the setting, the
severity of the problem, and the types of decisions to be made, some elements are
common across all reports. As we noted in Chapter 1 in Rapid Reference 1.1, reports follow an outline that includes standard sections. Although some sections
of a report may be longer or shorter depending on the nature of the referral ques-

tion, the complexity of the evaluation, and the writing style of the evaluator, the
general sections provide the structure for organization.

COMPONENTS OF WRITING STYLE

All  written  reports  should  communicate  assessment  results  clearly  and  effectively. When writing is clear and organized, the ideas are presented in a logical sequence, smooth transitions exist between topics, and paragraphs and sentences
are easy to understand.

Logical Organization

Organize a report logically on all levels: globally (so that the report forms a cohesive whole), within sections, and within paragraphs. To maintain the global organization of a report, keep the content relevant to a particular section within that
section. As we suggested in Chapter 1, do not describe test behaviors in the sec-

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

Comprehensive  written  reports  are  the  summation  and  culmination  of

most psychological and psycho-educational evaluations. These reports
summarize the data from test administration, integrate relevant qualitative information, and directly address the posed concerns. Because these documents  inform  decision  making  and  remain  for  years  in  academic,  as  well  as
medical and psychological records, they must be well written. When well written,
assessment reports can enhance treatment, guide and inform instruction, and
provide critical information to the referral source and others. The findings and
observations are presented clearly so that they are understandable to parents,
teachers, clients, and other professionals. In contrast, when poorly written, assessment reports may be incomprehensible to parents and teachers and the recommendations impossible or unrealistic to implement (Salend & Salend, 1985).
Because  the  results  from  a  report  can  affect  decisions  and  influence  decision
making for years beyond the initial evaluation, the creation of assessment reports
requires special attention and care.

COMPONENTS OF WRITING STYLE

Logical Organization

Organize a report logically on all levels: globally (so that the report forms a cohesive whole), within sections, and within paragraphs. To maintain the global organization of a report, keep the content relevant to a particular section within that
section. As we suggested in Chapter 1, do not describe test behaviors in the section on background information, and do not put instructional recommendations
in the section on test interpretation. Within each section of a report, organize the
information by topic. For example, organize the background information into
discrete paragraphs on developmental history, medical history, educational history, socioeconomic environment, and/or current family situation. Similarly, organize the behavioral observations into discrete paragraphs on topics such as
level of rapport, level of attention, attitude, and tolerance for frustration. Some
sections may require only one paragraph, whereas others may contain enough information for several. In the subsequent chapters of this book, we will provide
specific suggestions on how to organize topics within the various sections.

Smooth Transitions

adolescents than for adults, they are important for anyone who is assessed, regardless of age. Information gathered from a naturalistic setting can verify the
teachers’ and parents’ reports of a child’s behavior (or an adult client’s self-report)
and can also provide a comparison to the behavior you observe in the structured
testing environment.

Observational systems can be designed to meet your particular needs for a
given assessment. At times you may want to have more quantitative information
about behaviors, and at other times qualitative components of behavior may be

most important. Generally, a trained observer will either record a variety of behaviors or focus on one or two specific problematic behaviors. The referral question and other test data help determine the types of information to be gathered
from the observation.

When  observing  behaviors  in  a  naturalistic  setting,  consider  these  general
guidelines. An effective observation is planned carefully and systematically. Before beginning, determine several key components of the observation, including
what behaviors will be observed, where the observations will take place, and how
the behaviors will be recorded. In defining the behavior or behaviors that will be
observed, be as specific as possible. Clear and concise definitions of behavior will
help distinguish the target behaviors from other similar behaviors. For example,
you may define cooperative behavior by focusing on the specific behaviors involved in cooperation, such as taking turns during games or working together to
build something. Other types of behavior are easier to define, such as hitting or
crying. Rapid Reference 4.3 lists several behaviors that can be observed using an
observational system.

In addition to observing a person’s behaviors, you may find it helpful to observe and record the antecedents to the behaviors. For example, if the targeted
constellation of behaviors includes aggression, and you observe the child grab-

Main Principles for Writing Summaries

Observation of several main principles can help you write effective summaries.
In general, attempt to keep your summaries short; do not introduce any new material, avoid vague and ambiguous statements, and describe what the person can,
as well as cannot, do. These key principles are discussed briefly in the following
sections.

Keep It Concise
Do not attempt to restate everything that was said in earlier sections. Summaries
should rarely exceed one page in length and often can be accomplished in one
paragraph. In most instances, the reason for referral can be summarized in one
or two sentences, key points from the Background Information section can be
summarized in one to three sentences, and the key behavioral observations can
be described in one to three sentences. Depending on the complexity of the assessment, the summary of the Test Results and Interpretation section can range
from a couple of sentences to one or two paragraphs. Often, multiple key findings can be combined into one sentence.

C A U T I O N

Do not add new information or interpretations of the data in the summary.

Humm…Why does this
report conclude with a
diagnosis of depression when
it was not mentioned before?

Do Not Include New Material
Do not include any new information
in the summary. If new information is
introduced in this section, then readers will not know how you arrived at a
specific conclusion (see the Caution).
When readers read the summary, they
should think, “This provides a clear
synthesis  of  what  I  just  read,”  not
“How  did  the  evaluator  reach  these
conclusions?”

## Response
The key components of effective report writing include:

1. **Logical Organization**: Reports should be organized logically at all levels to form a cohesive whole. This includes maintaining relevance within sections and ensuring smooth transitions between topics.

2. **Clear and Concise Writing**: Use simple words and concise sentences to communicate key findings effectively. Avoid redundancies and unnecessary information to keep the report clear and to the point.

3. **Comprehensive Framework**: Reports typically follow a standard outline that includes sections like reason for referral, background information, observations, test results, and recommendations.

4. **Summary Section**: Summarize key ideas from each part of the report, restate facts without repetition, and include diagnostic or clinical impressions. Ensure it aids readers in transitioning to recommendations.

5. **Attention to Audience**: Be mindful of the report’s audience and the context in which it will be used, ensuring that sensitive information is handled appropriately.

6. **Technical Accuracy**: Grammatically correct, error-free writing enhances credibility and ensures the report is taken seriously.

7. **Effective Use of Transition Words**: Employ transition links to maintain coherence and guide readers through the report's narrative.

These components collectively make a report well-structured, clear, and effective in communicating necessary information for decision-making processes.
